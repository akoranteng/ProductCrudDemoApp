# ProductCrudDemoApp

A modular Blazor Web App demonstrating EF Core–backed CRUD operations.  
This project is designed as a clean, step‑by‑step learning resource for building real‑world data‑driven applications with modern .NET.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Build a clean, database‑backed CRUD application using **Blazor Web App**
- Use **EF Core + SQLite** for real data persistence
- Demonstrate modular, incremental development using Git feature branches
- Provide a clear, reproducible learning path for beginners and intermediate developers
- Serve as a foundation for future modules (APIs, MAUI Hybrid, Syncfusion, etc.)

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **.NET 8 / .NET 9**
- **Blazor Web App (Server Interactivity)**
- **Entity Framework Core**
- **SQLite**
- **C# 12+**
- **Visual Studio 2022** or **VS Code**

## 📂 Branch Structure (Planned)

| Branch | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `main` | Stable, production‑ready baseline |
| `01-setup-efcore` | Add EF Core, SQLite, DbContext, migrations |
| `02-models-product` | Add Product model + validation |
| `03-ui-list` | Product list page with database data |
| `04-ui-create` | Create form with validation + persistence |
| `05-ui-edit` | Edit form with EF Core tracking |
| `06-ui-details` | Details page |
| `07-ui-delete` | Delete confirmation + removal |
| `08-polish` | UI cleanup, navigation, layout improvements |

This structure keeps the project modular and easy to follow.
